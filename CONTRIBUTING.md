# Contributing

Thank you for helping keep the std-replacement dataset accurate and useful.

## Adding or changing an entry

Each crate lives in its own file at `data/<crate>.toml` with two fields:

- `description`: Markdown explaining the replacement. It must cite the stable
  `std` API(s) and the Rust version(s) that stabilized them.
- `url`: a docs or release-notes link, shown as a "Learn more" link.

Open one pull request per crate. `build.py` validates the dataset in CI, so run
it locally first:

```sh
python3 build.py
```

## What qualifies

Standard-library replacements only. The dataset deliberately avoids "prefer this
nicer crate instead" recommendations. Every entry is a checkable factual
statement about `std`, never an opinion about a competing crate.

The functionality must have shipped in a stable Rust release. If the
functionality only exists in nightly or beta, go ahead and file a draft PR and
start the discussion period with the crate maintainer, but the PR should not
get merged until the functionality exists in stable Rust.

Two kinds of entries qualify:

- **Full**: the crate's functionality is entirely available through a stable
  `std` API.
- **Partial**: the bulk of the crate's common use case is available in stable
  `std`, but not all of it. The `description` must spell out what is still
  missing.

Coverage is judged by the dominant use case. If only a small slice of a crate's
purpose lives in `std`, it does not qualify. Some canonical examples of
exclusions are `itertools`, `libc`, and `rustix`. Some of their functionality
has been added to `std`, but the crates are not replaced, in whole or in part.

## Maintainer notice-and-comment

Before an entry lands, the maintainer(s) of the flagged crate get a window to
weigh in, either to object or to show that the replacement is less complete than
claimed, in which case the entry becomes partial or is dropped. (This window may
be waived if the crate documentation specifically expresses that the crate is
deprecated in favor of the standard library, or if it explicitly exists only as
a backport for older MSRVs.)
